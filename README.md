#kinematic abstractions for puredata

A pure data abstraction library for dealing with kinematics to control things like robots.

Use at your own risk. I can not guarantee that anything works properly.

If you are interested in contributing please fork, fix things, add stuff by staying consistant with the given naming stratagy, and then send me a pull request.

I have made all attempts heavily rely on [expr] for math stuff and keeping everything vanilla when at all possible.

This Library is intended to do other physical computing stuff other than kinematics like reading from arduino board etc.
